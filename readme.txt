Energia is a fork of Arduino for the Texas Instruments MSP430 Micro Controller. The Sprite picosatellite required
a fork of Energia for the CC430. This code is based on a branch of that fork, as well as the ARTSAT2 DESPATCH code,
aiming to be launched with KickSat 2.

For more information on the Sprite, see https://kicksat.github.io/
